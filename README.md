## Conclusions
- Lending club should reduce the high interest loans for 60 months tenure, they are prone to loan
  default.
- Small business loans are defaulted more. Lending club should stop/reduce issuing the loans to
  them.
- Borrowers with mortgage home ownership are taking higher loans and defaulting the approved
  loans. Lending club should stop giving loans to this category when loan amount requested is more
  than 12000.
- Lending Club should control their number of loan issues to borrowers who are from CA, FL and
  NY to make profits.
- Grades are good metric for detecting defaulters. Lending club should examine more information
  from borrowers before issuing loans to Low grade (G to A).
- People with more number of public derogatory records are having more chance of filing a
  bankruptcy. Lending club should make sure there are no public derogatory records for borrower.
